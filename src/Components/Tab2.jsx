        <p className="scopus-paragraph">
          A Scopus-indexed journal is a scholarly publication that has been
          reviewed and approved for inclusion in Scopus. It is one of the
          world's largest, most trusted abstract and citation databases for
          academic research. Managed by Elsevier, Scopus indexes only
          high-quality journals that follow rigorous editorial policies,
          peer-review processes, and ethical publishing practices. Covering more
          than 40,000 titles across science, engineering, technology, medicine,
          social sciences, arts, and humanities, Scopus serves as a key resource
          for researchers, academicians, and institutions worldwide. Being
          indexed in Scopus signifies that a journal has met international
          standards of research excellence, visibility, and impact, making it a
          highly credible platform for academic publication.
